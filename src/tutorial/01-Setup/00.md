Setup
-----

To create an sbt project, you'll need to take these steps:

-   Install sbt and create a script to launch it.
-   Setup a simple [hello world][Hello] project
    -   Create a project directory with source files in it.
    -   Create your build definition.
-   Move on to [running][Running] to learn how to run sbt.
-   Then move on to [.sbt build definition][Basic-Def] to learn more
    about build definitions.

### Installing sbt

Ultimately, the installation of sbt boils down to a launcher JAR and a shell script,
but depending on your platform, we provide several ways to make the process less tedious.
Head over to the installation steps for [Mac][Mac], [Windows][Windows], [Linux][Linux], or [manual installation][Manual-Installation].

### Tips and Notes

If you have any trouble running sbt, see [Setup Notes][Setup-Notes] on
terminal encodings, HTTP proxies, and JVM options.
