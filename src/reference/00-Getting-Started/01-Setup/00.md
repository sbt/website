Installing sbt
--------------

To create an sbt project, you'll need to take these steps:

-   Install JDK (We recommend Oracle JDK 8 or OpenJDK 8).
-   Install sbt.
-   Setup a simple [hello world][Hello] project
-   Move on to [running][Running] to learn how to run sbt.
-   Then move on to [.sbt build definition][Basic-Def] to learn more
    about build definitions.

Ultimately, the installation of sbt boils down to a launcher JAR
and a shell script, but depending on your platform, we provide
several ways to make the process less tedious.  Head over to the
installation steps for [Mac][Mac], [Windows][Windows], or
[Linux][Linux].

### Tips and Notes

If you have any trouble running sbt, see [Setup Notes][Setup-Notes] on
terminal encodings, HTTP proxies, and JVM options.
