Installing sbt on Linux
-----------------------

### Installing from SDKMAN

To install both JDK and sbt, consider using [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/).

```
\$ sdk list java
\$ sdk install java 11.0.6.hs-adpt
\$ sdk install sbt
```

This has two advantages.
1. It will install the official packaging by AdoptOpenJDK, as opposed to the ["mystery meat OpenJDK builds"](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8u-dev/2019-May/009330.html).
2. It will install `tgz` packaging of sbt that contains all JAR files. (DEB and RPM packages do not to save bandwidth)

### Install JDK

You must first install a JDK. We recommend **AdoptOpenJDK JDK 8** or **JDK 11**.

The details around the package names differ from one distribution to another. For example, Ubuntu xenial (16.04LTS) has [openjdk-8-jdk](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hu/xenial/openjdk-8-jdk). Redhat family calls it [java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel).

### Installing from a universal package

Download [ZIP][ZIP] or [TGZ][TGZ] package and expand it.

### Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions

[DEB][DEB] package is officially supported by sbt.

Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions use the DEB format, but usually you don't install your software from a local DEB file. Instead they come with package managers both for the command line (e.g. `apt-get`, `aptitude`) or with a graphical user interface (e.g. Synaptic).
Run the following from the terminal to install `sbt` (You'll need superuser privileges to do so, hence the `sudo`).

    echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
    curl -sL "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823" | sudo apt-key add
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install sbt

Package managers will check a number of configured repositories for packages to offer for installation. sbt binaries are published to Bintray, and conveniently Bintray provides an APT repository. You just have to add the repository to the places your package manager will check.

Once `sbt` is installed, you'll be able to manage the package in `aptitude` or Synaptic after you updated their package cache. You should also be able to see the added repository at the bottom of the list in System Settings -> Software & Updates -> Other Software:

**Note**: There have been reports about SSL error using Ubuntu: `Server access Error: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unexpected error: java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty url=https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-sbt/sbt/1.1.0/sbt-1.1.0.pom`, which apparently stems from OpenJDK 9 using PKCS12 format for `/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts` [cert-bug][cert-bug]. According to <https://stackoverflow.com/a/50103533/3827> it is fixed in Ubuntu Cosmic (18.10), but Ubuntu Bionic LTS (18.04) is still waiting for a release. See the answer for a workaround.

**Note**: `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823` may not work on Ubuntu Bionic LTS (18.04) since it's using a buggy GnuPG, so we are advising to use web API to download the public key in the above.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux and other RPM-based distributions

[RPM][RPM] package is officially supported by sbt.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux and other RPM-based distributions use the RPM format.
Run the following from the terminal to install `sbt` (You'll need superuser privileges to do so, hence the `sudo`).

    curl https://bintray.com/sbt/rpm/rpm | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/bintray-sbt-rpm.repo
    sudo yum install sbt

sbt binaries are published to Bintray, and conveniently Bintray provides an RPM repository. You just have to add the repository to the places your package manager will check.

On Fedora, `sbt 0.13.1` [available on official repos](https://fedora.pkgs.org/28/fedora-i386/sbt-0.13.1-9.fc28.1.noarch.rpm.html). If you want to install `sbt 1.1.6` or above, you may need to uninstall `sbt 0.13` (if it's installed) and indicate that you want to install the newest version of `sbt` (i.e. `sbt 1.1.6` or above) using `bintray-sbt-rpm.repo` then.
    
    sudo dnf remove sbt # uninstalling sbt if sbt 0.13 was installed (may not be necessary)
    sudo dnf --enablerepo=bintray--sbt-rpm install sbt

> **Note:** Please report any issues with these to the

> project.

### Gentoo

The official tree contains ebuilds for sbt. To install the latest available version do:

    emerge dev-java/sbt
