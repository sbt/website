Getting Started with sbt
========================

sbt uses a small number of concepts to support flexible and powerful
build definitions. There are not that many concepts, but sbt is not
exactly like other build systems and there are details you *will*
stumble on if you haven't read the documentation.

The Getting Started Guide covers the concepts you need to know to create
and maintain an sbt build definition.

It is *highly recommended* to read the Getting Started Guide!

If you are in a huge hurry, the most important conceptual background can
be found in [build definition][Basic-Def], [scopes][Scopes], and
[task graph][Task-Graph]. But we don't promise that
it's a good idea to skip the other pages in the guide.

It's best to read in order, as later pages in the Getting Started Guide
build on concepts introduced earlier.

Thanks for trying out sbt and *have fun*!
