Build definition
----------------

This page describes sbt build definitions, including some "theory" and
the syntax of `build.sbt`.
It assumes you have installed a recent version of sbt, such as sbt 0.13.13,
know how to [use sbt][Running],
and have read the previous pages in the Getting Started Guide.

This page discusses the `build.sbt` build definition.

### Specifying the sbt version

As part of your build definition you will specify the version of
sbt that your build uses.
This allows people with different versions of the sbt launcher to
build the same projects with consistent results.
To do this, create a file named `project/build.properties` that specifies the sbt version as follows:

```
sbt.version=$app_version$
```

If the required version is not available locally,
the `sbt` launcher will download it for you.
If this file is not present, the `sbt` launcher will choose an arbitrary version,
which is discouraged because it makes your build non-portable.

### What is a build definition?

A *build definition* is defined in `build.sbt`,
and it consists of a set of projects (of type [`Project`](../api/sbt/Project.html)).
Because the term *project* can be ambiguous,
we often call it a *subproject* in this guide.

For instance, in `build.sbt` you define
the subproject located in the current directory like this:

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "Hello",
    scalaVersion := "$example_scala_version$"
  )
```

`lazy val proj = (project in file("dir")` defines a subproject `proj` in the 
directory **./dir**. 

The build definition can contain a number of such subprojects: 

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "Hello",
  )

lazy val projX = (project in file("x"))

lazy val projY = (project in file("y"))
```


Each subproject is configured by key-value pairs.

For example, one key is `name` and it maps to a string value, the name of
your subproject.
The key-value pairs are listed under the `.settings(...)` method as follows:

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "Hello",
    scalaVersion := "$example_scala_version$"
  )
```

### How build.sbt defines settings

`build.sbt` defines subprojects, which holds a sequence of key-value pairs
called *setting expressions* using *build.sbt DSL*.

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name         := "hello",
    organization := "com.example",
    scalaVersion := "$example_scala_version$",
    version      := "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  )
```

Let's take a closer look at the `build.sbt` DSL:
![setting expression](files/setting-expression.png)<br>
<br>
Each entry is called a *setting expression*.
Some among them are also called task expressions.
We will see more on the difference later in this page.

A setting expression consists of three parts:

1. Left-hand side is a *key*.
2. *Operator*, which in this case is `:=`
3. Right-hand side is called the *body*, or the *setting body*.

On the left-hand side, `name`, `version`, and `scalaVersion` are *keys*.
A key is an instance of
[`SettingKey[T]`](../api/index.html#sbt.SettingKey),
[`TaskKey[T]`](../api/index.html#sbt.TaskKey), or
[`InputKey[T]`](../api/index.html#sbt.InputKey) where `T` is the
expected value type. The kinds of key are explained below.

Because key `name` is typed to `SettingKey[String]`,
the `:=` operator on `name` is also typed specifically to `String`.
If you use the wrong value type, the build definition will not compile:

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := 42  // will not compile
  )
```

`build.sbt` may also be
interspersed with `val`s, `lazy val`s, and `def`s. Top-level `object`s and
`class`es are not allowed in `build.sbt`. Those should go in the `project/`
directory as Scala source files.

### Keys

#### Types

There are three flavors of key:

- `SettingKey[T]`: a key for a value computed once (the value is
  computed when loading the subproject, and kept around).
- `TaskKey[T]`: a key for a value, called a *task*, that has to be
  recomputed each time, potentially with side effects.
- `InputKey[T]`: a key for a task that has command line arguments as
  input. Check out [Input Tasks][Input-Tasks] for more details.

#### Built-in Keys

The built-in keys are just fields in an object called
[Keys](../sxr/sbt/Keys.scala.html). A `build.sbt` implicitly has an
`import sbt.Keys._`, so `sbt.Keys.name` can be referred to as `name`.

#### Custom Keys

Custom keys may be defined with their respective creation methods:
`settingKey`, `taskKey`, and `inputKey`. Each method expects the type of the
value associated with the key as well as a description. The name of the
key is taken from the `val` the key is assigned to. For example, to define
a key for a new task called `hello`,

```scala
lazy val hello = taskKey[Unit]("An example task")
```

Here we have used the fact that an `.sbt` file can contain `val`s and `def`s
in addition to settings. All such definitions are evaluated before
settings regardless of where they are defined in the file.

> **Note:** Typically, lazy vals are used instead of vals to avoid initialization
> order problems.

#### Task vs Setting keys

A `TaskKey[T]` is said to define a *task*. Tasks are operations such as
`compile` or `package`. They may return `Unit` (`Unit` is Scala for `void`), or
they may return a value related to the task, for example `package` is a
`TaskKey[File]` and its value is the jar file it creates.

Each time you start a task execution, for example by typing `compile` at
the interactive sbt prompt, sbt will re-run any tasks involved exactly
once.

sbt's key-value pairs describing the subproject can keep around a fixed string value
for a setting such as name, but it has to keep around some executable
code for a task such as `compile` -- even if that executable code
eventually returns a string, it has to be re-run every time.

*A given key always refers to either a task or a plain setting.* That
is, "taskiness" (whether to re-run each time) is a property of the key,
not the value.

### Defining tasks and settings

Using `:=`, you can assign a value to a setting and a computation to a
task. For a setting, the value will be computed once at project load
time. For a task, the computation will be re-run each time the task is
executed.

For example, to implement the `hello` task from the previous section:

```scala
lazy val hello = taskKey[Unit]("An example task")

lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    hello := { println("Hello!") }
  )
```

We already saw an example of defining settings when we defined the
project's name,

```scala
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "hello"
  )
```

#### Types for tasks and settings

From a type-system perspective, the `Setting` created from a task key is
slightly different from the one created from a setting key.
`taskKey := 42` results in a `Setting[Task[T]]` while `settingKey := 42`
results in a `Setting[T]`. For most purposes this makes no difference; the
task key still creates a value of type `T` when the task executes.

The `T` vs. `Task[T]` type difference has this implication: a setting can't
depend on a task, because a setting is evaluated only once on project
load and is not re-run. More on this in [task graph][Task-Graph].

### Keys in sbt shell

In sbt shell, you can type the name of any task to execute
that task. This is why typing `compile` runs the `compile` task. `compile` is
a task key.

If you type the name of a setting key rather than a task key, the value
of the setting key will be displayed. Typing a task key name executes
the task but doesn't display the resulting value; to see a task's
result, use `show <task name>` rather than plain `<task name>`. The
convention for keys names is to use `camelCase` so that the command line
name and the Scala identifiers are the same.

To learn more about any key, type `inspect <keyname>` at the sbt
interactive prompt. Some of the information `inspect` displays won't make
sense yet, but at the top it shows you the setting's value type and a
brief description of the setting.

### Imports in build.sbt

You can place import statements at the top of `build.sbt`; they need not
be separated by blank lines.

There are some implied default imports, as follows:

```scala
import sbt._
import Process._
import Keys._
```

(In addition, if you have auto plugins, the names marked under `autoImport` will be imported.)


### Bare .sbt build definition

Instead of defining `Project`s, bare `.sbt` build definition consists of
a list of `Setting[_]` expressions.

```scala
name := "hello"
version := "1.0"
scalaVersion := "$example_scala_version$"
```

This syntax is recommended mostly for using plugins. See later section
about the plugins.

### Adding library dependencies

To depend on third-party libraries, there are two options. The first is
to drop jars in `lib/` (unmanaged dependencies) and the other is to add
managed dependencies, which will look like this in `build.sbt`:

```scala
val derby = "org.apache.derby" % "derby" % "10.4.1.3"

lazy val commonSettings = Seq(
  organization := "com.example",
  version := "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT",
  scalaVersion := "$example_scala_version$"
)

lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    commonSettings,
    name := "Hello",
    libraryDependencies += derby
  )
```

This is how you add a managed dependency on the Apache Derby library,
version 10.4.1.3.

The `libraryDependencies` key involves two complexities: `+=` rather than
`:=`, and the `%` method. `+=` appends to the key's old value rather than
replacing it, this is explained in
[Task Graph][Task-Graph]. The `%`
method is used to construct an Ivy module ID from strings, explained in
[Library dependencies][Library-Dependencies].

We'll skip over the details of library dependencies until later in the
Getting Started Guide. There's a
[whole page][Library-Dependencies] covering it later on.
