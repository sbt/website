sbt Reference Manual
====================

sbt is a build tool for Scala, Java, and
[more](https://github.com/d40cht/sbt-cpp). It requires Java 1.6 or
later.

### Install

See [Installing sbt][Setup] for the setup instructions.

### Getting Started

To get started, *please read* the
[Getting Started Guide][Getting-Started]. You will save
yourself a *lot* of time if you have the right understanding of the big
picture up-front.
All documentation may be found via the table of contents included at the end of every page.

Use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/sbt) for
questions. Use the [sbt-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/sbt-dev) for discussing sbt
development. Use [@scala_sbt](https://twitter.com/scala_sbt) for questions and discussions.

### Features of sbt

-   Little or no configuration required for simple projects
-   Scala-based [build definition][Basic-Def] that can
    use the full flexibility of Scala code
-   Accurate incremental recompilation using information extracted from
    the compiler
-   Continuous compilation and testing with
    [triggered execution][Triggered-Execution]
-   Packages and publishes jars
-   Generates documentation with scaladoc
-   Supports mixed Scala/[Java][Java-Sources] projects
-   Supports [testing][Testing] with ScalaCheck,
    specs, and ScalaTest. JUnit is supported by a plugin.
-   Starts the Scala REPL with project classes and dependencies on the
    classpath
-   Modularization supported with
    [sub-projects][Multi-Project]
-   External project support (list a git repository as a dependency!)
-   [Parallel task execution][Parallel-Execution],
    including parallel test execution
-   [Library management support][Library-Dependencies]:
    inline declarations, external Ivy or Maven configuration files, or
    manual management
