### sbt 1.4.0

The headline features of sbt 1.4.0 are:

- build server protocol (BSP) support
- sbtn: a native thin client for sbt
- build caching
- `ThisBuild / versionScheme` to take the guessing out of eviction warning

### Build server protocol (BSP) support

sbt 1.4.0 adds build server protocol (BSP) support, contributed by [Scala Center](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/build-server-protocol-in-sbt/4234). Main implementation was done by Adrien Piquerez ([@adpi2](https://twitter.com/adrienpi2)) based on [@eed3si9n](https://twitter.com/eed3si9n)'s prototype.

When sbt 1.4.0 starts, it will create a file named `.bsp/sbt.json` containing a machine-readable instruction on how to run `sbt -bsp`, which is a command line program that uses standard input and output to communicate to sbt server using build server protocol.

#### How to import to IntelliJ using BSP

1. Start sbt in a terminal
2. Open IntelliJ IDEA 2020.1.2 or later
3. Select "Open or import", and select "BSP Project"

#### How to import to VS Code + Metals

1. Delete existing `.bsp`, `.metals`, `.bloop` directories if any
2. Open VS Code in the working directory
3. Ignore the prompt to import the project
4. Start `sbt -Dsbt.semanticdb=true` in the Terminal tab. Wait till it displays "sbt server started"
5. Navigate to Metals view, and select "Restart build server"
6. Type `compile` into the sbt session to generate SemanticDB files

[#5538][5538]/[#5443][5443] by [@adpi2][@adpi2]

### Native thin client

sbt 1.4.0 adds an official native thin client called `sbtn` that supports all tasks. If you're using the official sbt launcher 1.4.0 and not the knockoff kind you can use `--client` option to run the native thin client:

```
\$ sbt --client compile
\$ sbt --client shutdown
```

The native thin client will run sbt (server) as a daemon, which avoids the JVM spinup and loading time for the second call onwards. This could be an option if you would like to use sbt from the system shell such as Zsh and Fish.

Remember to call `sbt --client shutdown` when you're done! If you want to enable this via an environment variable you can set `SBT_NATIVE_CLIENT` to `true`.
`sbtn` binary files are also available from https://github.com/sbt/sbtn-dist/releases/tag/v1.4.0

[#5620][5620] by [@eatkins][@eatkins]

### ThisBuild / versionScheme

sbt 1.4.0 adds a new setting called `ThisBuild / versionScheme` to track version scheme of the build:

```
ThisBuild / versionScheme := Some("early-semver")
```

The supported values are `"early-semver"`, `"pvp"`, and `"semver-spec"`. sbt will include this information into `pom.xml` and `ivy.xml` as a property. In addition, sbt 1.4.0 will use the information to take the guessing out of eviction warning when this information is available. [#5724][5724] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### VirtualFile + RemoteCache

sbt 1.4.0 / Zinc 1.4.0 virtualizes the file paths tracked during incremental compilation. The benefit for this that the state of incremental compilation can shared across _different_ machines, as long as `ThisBuild / rootPaths` are enumerated beforehand.

To demonstrate this, we've also added **experimental** [cached compilation](http://eed3si9n.com/cached-compilation-for-sbt) feature to sbt. All you need is the following setting:

```
ThisBuild / pushRemoteCacheTo := Some(MavenCache("local-cache", file("/tmp/remote-cache")))
```

Then from machine 1, call `pushRemoteCache`. This will publish the `*.class` and Zinc Analysis artifacts to the location. Next, from machine 2, call `pullRemoteCache`.

[zinc#712][zinc712]/[#5417][5417] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Build linting

On start up, sbt 1.4.0 checks for unused settings/tasks. Because most settings are on the intermediary to other settings/tasks, they are included into the linting by default. The notable exceptions are settings used exclusively by a command. To opt-out, you can either append it to `Global / excludeLintKeys` or set the rank to invisible.

[#5153][5153] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Conditional task

sbt 1.4.0 adds support for conditional task (or Selective task), which is a new kind of task automatically created when `Def.task { ... }` consists of an `if`-expression:

```
bar := {
  if (number.value < 0) negAction.value
  else if (number.value == 0) zeroAction.value
  else posAction.value
}
```

Unlike the regular (Applicative) task composition, conditional tasks delays the evaluation of then-clause and else-clause as naturally expected of an `if`-expression. This is already possible with `Def.taskDyn { ... }`, but unlike dynamic tasks, conditional task works with `inspect` command. See [Selective functor for sbt](http://eed3si9n.com/selective-functor-in-sbt) for more details. [#5558][5558] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### Incremental build pipelining

sbt 1.4.0 adds experimental incremental build pipelining. To enable build pipelining for the build:

```
ThisBuild / usePipelining := true
```

To opt-out of creating an early output for some of the subprojects:

```
exportPipelining := false
```

[#5703][5703] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### sbt-dependency-graph is in-sourced

sbt 1.4.0 brings in Johannes Rudolph's sbt-dependency-graph plugin into the code base.
Since it injects many tasks per subprojects, the plugin is split into two parts:
- `MiniDependencyTreePlugin` that is enabled by default, bringing in `dependencyTree` task to `Compile` and `Test` configurations
- Full strength `DependencyTreePlugin` that is enabled by putting the following to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```
addDependencyTreePlugin
```

### Fixes with compatibility implications
