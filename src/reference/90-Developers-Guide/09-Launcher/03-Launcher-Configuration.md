sbt Launcher Configuration
--------------------------

The launcher may be configured in one of the following ways in
increasing order of precedence:

-   Replace the `/sbt/sbt.boot.properties` file in the launcher jar
-   Put a configuration file named `sbt.boot.properties` on the
    classpath. Put it in the classpath root without the /sbt prefix.
-   Specify the location of an alternate configuration on the command
    line, either as a path or an absolute URI. This can be done by
    either specifying the location as the system property
    sbt.boot.properties or as the first argument to the launcher
    prefixed by `@`. The system property has lower precedence.
    Resolution of a relative path is first attempted against the current
    working directory, then against the user's home directory, and then
    against the directory containing the launcher jar.

An error is generated if none of these attempts succeed.

### Example

The default configuration file for sbt as an application looks like:

```
[scala]
  version: ${sbt.scala.version-auto}

[app]
  org: ${sbt.organization-org.scala-sbt}
  name: sbt
  version: ${sbt.version-read(sbt.version)[0.12.0]}
  class: ${sbt.main.class-sbt.xMain}
  components: xsbti,extra
  cross-versioned: ${sbt.cross.versioned-false}

[repositories]
  local
  typesafe-ivy-releases: http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/, [organization]/[module]/[revision]/[type]s/[artifact](-[classifier]).[ext]
  maven-central
  sonatype-snapshots: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots

[boot]
 directory: ${sbt.boot.directory-${sbt.global.base-${user.home}/.sbt}/boot/}

[ivy]
  ivy-home: ${sbt.ivy.home-${user.home}/.ivy2/}
  checksums: ${sbt.checksums-sha1,md5}
  override-build-repos: ${sbt.override.build.repos-false}
  repository-config: ${sbt.repository.config-${sbt.global.base-${user.home}/.sbt}/repositories}
```

Let's look at all the launcher configuration sections in detail:

#### 1. Scala Configuration

The `[scala]` section is used to configure the version of Scala. It has
one property:

-   `version` - The version of Scala an application uses, or `auto` if
    the application is not cross-versioned.
-   `classifiers` - The (optional) list of additional Scala artifacts to
    resolve, e.g. sources.

#### 2. Application Identification

The `[app]` section configures how the launcher will look for your
application using the Ivy dependency manager. It consists of the
following properties:

-   `org` - The organization associated with the Ivy module. (`groupId` in
    Maven vernacular)
-   `name` - The name of the Ivy module. (`artifactId` in Maven
    vernacular)
-   `version` - The revision of the Ivy module.
-   `class` - The name of the "entry point" into the application. An
    entry point must be a class which meets one of the following critera
    -   Extends the `xsbti.AppMain` interface.
    -   Extends the `xsbti.ServerMain` interfaces.
    -   Contains a method with the signature `static void main(String[])`
    -   Contains a method with the signature `static int main(String[])`
    - Contains a method with the signature `static xsbti.Exit main(String[])`
-   `components` - An optional list of additional components that Ivy
    should resolve.
-   `cross-versioned` - An optional string denoting how this application
    is published. If `app.cross-versioned` is binary, the resolved module
    ID is
    `{app.name+'_'+CrossVersion.binaryScalaVersion(scala.version)}`. If
    `app.cross-versioned` is `true` or `full`, the resolved module ID is
    `{app.name+'_'+scala.version}`. The `scala.version` property must be
    specified and cannot be `auto` when cross-versioned.
-   `resources` - An optional list of jar files that should be added to
    the application's classpath.
-   `classifiers` - An optional list of additional classifiers that
    should be resolved with this application, e.g. sources.

#### 3. Repositories Section

The `[repositories]` section configures where and how Ivy will look for
your application. Each line denotes a repository where Ivy will look.

*Note: This section configured the default location where Ivy will look,
but this can be overriden via user configuration.*

There are several built-in strings that can be used for common
repositories:

-   `local` - the local Ivy repository `~/.ivy2/local`.
-   `maven-local` - The local Maven repository `~/.m2/repository`.
-   `maven-central` - The Maven Central repository `repo.maven.org`.

Besides built in repositories, other repositories can be configured
using the following syntax:

> name: url(, pattern)(,descriptorOptional)(,skipConsistencyCheck)

The `name` property is an identifier which Ivy uses to cache modules
resolved from this location. The `name` should be unique across all
repositories.

The `url` property is the base `url` where Ivy should look for modules.

The `pattern` property is an optional specification of *how* Ivy should
look for modules. By default, the launcher assumes repositories are in
the maven style format.

The `skipConsistencyCheck` string is used to tell Ivy not to validate
checksums and signatures of files it resolves.

#### 4. The Boot section

The `[boot]` section is used to configure where the sbt launcher will
store its cache and configuration information. It consists of the
following properties:

-   `directory` - The directory defined here is used to store all cached
    JARs resolved launcher.
-   `properties` - (optional) A properties file to use for any `read`
    variables.

#### 5. The Ivy section

The `[ivy]` section is used to configure the Ivy dependency manager for
resolving applications. It consists of the following properties:

-   `ivy-home` - The home directory for Ivy. This determines where the
    ivy-local repository is located, and also where the Ivy cache is
    stored. Defaults to `~/.ivy2`
-   `checksums` - The comma-separated list of checksums that Ivy should
    use to verify artifacts have correctly resolved, e.g. md5 or sha1.
-   `override-build-repos` - If this is set, then the
    `isOverrideRepositories` method on `xsbti.Launcher` interface will
    return its value. The use of this method is application-specific,
    but in the case of sbt denotes that the configuration of
    repositories in the launcher should override those used by any
    build. Applications should respect this convention if they can.
-   `repository-config` - This specifies a configuration location where
    Ivy repositories can also be configured. If this file exists, then
    its contents override the `[repositories]` section.

#### 6. The Server Section

When using the `--locate` feature of the launcher, this section
configures how a server is started. It consists of the following
properties:

-   `lock` - The file that controls access to the running server. This
    file will contain the active port used by a server and must be
    located on a a filesystem that supports locking.
-   `jvmargs` - A file that contains line-separated JVM arguments that were
    used when starting the server.
-   `jvmprops` - The location of a properties file that will define
    override properties in the server. All properties defined in this
    file will be set as `-D` Java properties.

### Variable Substitution

Property values may include variable substitutions. A variable
substitution has one of these forms:

-   `\${variable.name}`
-   `\${variable.name-default}`

where `variable.name` is the name of a system property. If a system
property by that name exists, the value is substituted. If it does not
exists and a default is specified, the default is substituted after
recursively substituting variables in it. If the system property does
not exist and no default is specified, the original string is not
substituted.

There is also a special variable substitution:

    read(property.name)[default]

This will look in the file configured by `boot.properties` for a value.
If there is no `boot.properties` file configured, or the property does
not exist, then the default value is chosen.

### Syntax

The configuration file is line-based, read as UTF-8 encoded, and defined
by the following grammar. `'nl'` is a newline or end of file and
`'text'` is plain text without newlines or the surrounding delimiters
(such as parentheses or square brackets):
