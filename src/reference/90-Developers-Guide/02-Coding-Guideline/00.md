sbt Coding Guideline
--------------------

This page discusses the coding style and other guidelines for sbt 1.0.

### General goal

sbt 1.0 will primarily target Scala 2.11.
We will cross-build against Scala 2.10.

#### Clean up old deprecation

Before 1.0 is release, we should clean up deprecations.

#### Aim for zero warnings (except deprecation)

On Scala 2.11 we should aim for zero warnings.
One exception may be deprecation if it's required for 2.10 cross-building.

### Modular design

#### Aim small

The fewer methods we can expose to the build user, the easier sbt becomes to maintain.

#### Public APIs should be coded against "interfaces"

Code against interfaces.

#### Hide implementation details

The implementation details should be hidden behind `sbt.internal.x` packages,
where `x` could be the name of the main package (like `io`).

#### Less interdependence

Independent modules with fewer dependent libraries are easier to reuse.

#### Hide external classes

Avoid exposing external classes in the API, except for standard Scala and Java classes.

#### Hide internal modules

A module may be declared internal if it has no use to the public.

#### Compiler flags

```
-encoding utf8
-deprecation
-feature
-unchecked
-Xlint
-language:higherKinds
-language:implicitConversions
-Xfuture
-Yinline-warnings
-Yno-adapted-args
-Ywarn-dead-code
-Ywarn-numeric-widen
-Ywarn-value-discard
-Xfatal-warnings
```

The `-Xfatal-warnings` may be removed if there are unavoidable warnings.

#### Package name and organization name

Use the package name appended with the layer name, such as `sbt.io` for IO layer.
The organization name for published artifacts should remain `org.scala-sbt`.

### Binary resiliency

A good overview on the topic of binary resiliency is [Josh's 2012 talk][jsuereth2012] on
Binary resiliency.
The guideline here applies mostly to publicly exposed APIs.

#### MiMa

Use [MiMa][mima].

#### Public traits should contain `def` declarations only

TODO: "results to codegen at subclass" is unclear

- `val` or `var` in `trait` results to codegen at subclass and at the artificial `Foo\$class.\$init\$`.
- `lazy val` results to codegen at subclass

#### Abstract classes are also useful

[To trait, or not to trait?][pins_trait127].
Abstract classes are less flexible than traits, but traits pose more problems for binary compatibility. Abstract classes also have better Java interoperability.

#### Seal traits and abstract classes

If there's no need to keep a class open, seal it.

#### Finalize the leaf classes

If there's no need to keep a class open, finalize it.

#### Typeclass and subclass inheritance

The typeclass pattern with pure traits might ease maintaining binary compatibility more so than subclassing.

#### Avoid case classes, use sbt-datatype

Case classes involve code generation that makes it harder to maintain binary compatibility over time.

#### Prefer method overloading over default parameter values

Default parameter values are effectively code generation,
which makes them difficult to maintain.

### Other public API matters

Here are other guidelines about the sbt public API.

#### Avoid Stringly-typed programming

Define datatypes.

#### Avoid overuse of `def apply`

`def apply` should be reserved for factory methods
in a companion object that returns type `T`.

#### Use specific datatypes (`Vector`, `List`, or `Array`), rather than `Seq`

`scala.Seq` is `scala.collection.Seq`, which is not immutable.
Default to `Vector`. Use `List` if constant prepending is needed.
Use `Array` if Java interoperability is needed.
Note that using mutable collections is perfectly fine within the implementation.

#### Avoid calling `toSeq` or anything with side-effects on `Set`

`Set` is fine if you stick to set operations, like `contains` and `subsetOf`.
More often than not, `toSeq` is called explicitly or implicitly,
or some side-effecting method is called from `map`.
This introduces non-determinism to the code.

#### Avoid calling `toSeq` on `Map`

Same as above. This will introduce non-determinism.

#### Avoid functions and tuples in the signature, if Java interoperability is needed

Instead of functions and tuples, turn them into a trait.
This applies where interoperability is a concern, like implementing
incremental compilation.

### Style matters

#### Use scalariform

sbt-houserules comes with scalariform for formatting source code consistently.

#### Avoid procedure syntax

Declare an explicit `Unit` return.

#### Define instances of typeclasses in their companion objects, when possible

This style is encouraged:

```scala
final class FooID {}
object FooID {
  implicit val fooIdPicklerUnpicker: PicklerUnpickler[FooID] = ???
}
```

#### Implicit conversions for syntax (enrich-my-library pattern) should be imported

Avoid defining implicit converters in companion objects and package objects.

Suppose the IO module introduces a `URL` enrichment called `RichURI`,
and LibraryManagement introduces a `String` enrichment called `GroupID` (for `ModuleID` syntax).
These implicit conversions should be defined in an object named `syntax` in the respective package:

```scala
package sbt.io

object syntax {
  implicit def uriToRichURI(uri: URI): RichURI = new RichURI(uri)
}
```

When all the layers are available, the `sbt` package should also define an object called `syntax`
which forwards implicit conversions from all the layers:

```scala
package sbt

object syntax {
  implicit def uriToRichURI(uri: URI): io.RichURI = io.syntax.uriToRichURI(uri)
  ....
}
```
