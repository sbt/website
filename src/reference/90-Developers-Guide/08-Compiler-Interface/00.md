Compiler Interface
------------------

The compiler interface is the communication link between sbt and the
Scala compiler.

It is used to get information from the Scala compiler, and must therefore
be compiled against the Scala version in use for the configured projects.

The code for this project can be found in the directory [internal/compiler-bridge](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/tree/v1.1.0/internal/compiler-bridge).
