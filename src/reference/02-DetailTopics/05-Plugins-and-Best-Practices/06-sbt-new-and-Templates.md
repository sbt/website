sbt new and Templates
---------------------

sbt has a command called new, to create new build definitions from a template.
The `new` command is extensible via a mechanism called the [template resolver](#Template+Resolver).

### Trying new command

First, you need a recent sbt launcher.

Next run `sbt new scala/scala3.g8` (for Scala 3) or
`sbt new scala/scala-seed.g8` (for Scala 2).

When asked for a project name, you can put `hello` or anything else
you want:

```
....
name [hello]:

Template applied in ./hello
```

This ran the template using [Giter8][giter8], prompted for a value for "name" (which has a default value of "hello", which we accepted hitting `[Enter]`), and created a build under `./hello`.

These are the standard templates for a "minimal" Scala project, but there are many other templates out there.

### Giter8 support

[Giter8][giter8] is a templating project originally started by Nathan Hamblen in 2010, and now maintained by the [foundweekends][foundweekends] project.
The unique aspect of Giter8 is that it uses GitHub (or any other git repository) to host the templates, so it allows anyone to participate in template creation. Here are some of the templates provided by official sources:

- [scala/scala3.g8](https://github.com/scala/scala3.g8)                                 (A template for Scala 3 projects)
- [scala/scala-seed.g8](https://github.com/scala/scala-seed.g8)                         (Seed template for Scala)
- [foundweekends/giter8.g8](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8.g8)                 (A template for Giter8 templates)
- [scala/hello-world.g8](https://github.com/scala/hello-world.g8)                       (A template to demonstrate a minimal Scala application)
- [scala/scalatest-example.g8](https://github.com/scala/scalatest-example.g8)           (A template for trying out ScalaTest)

)

For more, see [Giter8 templates](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/wiki/giter8-templates) on the Giter8 wiki. sbt provides out-of-the-box support for Giter8 templates by shipping with a template resolver for Giter8.

#### Giter8 parameters

You can append Giter8 parameters to the end of the command, so for example to specify a particular branch you can use:

```
\$ sbt new scala/scala3.g8 --branch myBranch
```

#### How to create a Giter8 template

See [Making your own templates](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/template.html) for the details on how to create a new Giter8 template.

```
\$ sbt new foundweekends/giter8.g8
```

#### Use CC0 1.0 for template licensing

We recommend licensing software templates under [CC0 1.0][CC0],
which waives all copyrights and related rights, similar to the "public domain."

If you reside in a country covered by the Berne Convention, such as the US,
copyright will arise automatically without registration.
Thus, people won't have legal right to use your template if you do not
declare the terms of license.
The tricky thing is that even permissive licenses such as MIT License and Apache License will require attribution to your template in the template user's software.
To remove all claims to the templated snippets, distribute it under CC0, which is an international equivalent to public domain.

```

### How to extend sbt new

The rest of this page explains how to extend the `sbt new` command
to provide support for something other than Giter8 templates.
You can skip this section if you're not interested in extending `new`.

#### Template Resolver

A template resolver is a partial function that looks at the arguments
after `sbt new` and determines whether it can resolve to a particular template. This is analogous to `resolvers` resolving a `ModuleID` from the Internet.

The `Giter8TemplateResolver` takes the first argument that does not start with a hyphen (`-`), and checks whether it looks like
a GitHub repo or a git repo that ends in ".g8".
If it matches one of the patterns, it will pass the arguments to Giter8 to process.

To create your own template resolver, create a library that has `template-resolver` as a dependency:

```scala
val templateResolverApi = "org.scala-sbt" % "template-resolver" % "0.1"
```

and extend `TemplateResolver`, which is defined as:

```java
package sbt.template;

/** A way of specifying template resolver.
 */
public interface TemplateResolver {
  /** Returns true if this resolver can resolve the given argument.
   */
  public boolean isDefined(String[] arguments);
  /** Resolve the given argument and run the template.
   */
  public void run(String[] arguments);
}
```

Publish the library to sbt community repo or Maven Central.

#### templateResolverInfos

Next, create an sbt plugin that adds a `TemplateResolverInfo` to `templateResolverInfos`.

```scala
import Def.Setting
import Keys._

/** An experimental plugin that adds the ability for Giter8 templates to be resolved
 */
object Giter8TemplatePlugin extends AutoPlugin {
  override def requires = CorePlugin
  override def trigger = allRequirements

  override lazy val globalSettings: Seq[Setting[_]] =
    Seq(
      templateResolverInfos +=
        TemplateResolverInfo(ModuleID("org.scala-sbt.sbt-giter8-resolver", "sbt-giter8-resolver", "0.1.0") cross CrossVersion.binary,
          "sbtgiter8resolver.Giter8TemplateResolver")
    )
}
```

This indirecton allows template resolvers to have a classpath independent from the rest of the build.
