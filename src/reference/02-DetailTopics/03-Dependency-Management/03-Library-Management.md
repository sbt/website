Library Management
------------------

There's now a
[getting started page][Library-Dependencies] about
library management, which you may want to read first.

*Documentation Maintenance Note:* it would be nice to remove the overlap
between this page and the getting started page, leaving this page with
the more advanced topics such as checksums and external Ivy files.

### Introduction

There are two ways for you to manage libraries with sbt: manually or
automatically. These two ways can be mixed as well. This page discusses
the two approaches. All configurations shown here are settings that go
either directly in a
[.sbt file][Basic-Def] or are
appended to the `settings` of a Project in a
[.scala file][Full-Def].

### Manual Dependency Management

Manually managing dependencies involves copying any jars that you want
to use to the `lib` directory. sbt will put these jars on the classpath
during compilation, testing, running, and when using the interpreter.
You are responsible for adding, removing, updating, and otherwise
managing the jars in this directory. No modifications to your project
definition are required to use this method unless you would like to
change the location of the directory you store the jars in.

To change the directory jars are stored in, change the `unmanagedBase`
setting in your project definition. For example, to use `custom_lib/`:

```scala
unmanagedBase := baseDirectory.value / "custom_lib"
```

If you want more control and flexibility, override the `unmanagedJars`
task, which ultimately provides the manual dependencies to sbt. The
default implementation is roughly:

```scala
unmanagedJars in Compile := (baseDirectory.value ** "*.jar").classpath
```

If you want to add jars from multiple directories in addition to the
default directory, you can do:

```scala
unmanagedJars in Compile ++= {
    val base = baseDirectory.value
    val baseDirectories = (base / "libA") +++ (base / "b" / "lib") +++ (base / "libC")
    val customJars = (baseDirectories ** "*.jar") +++ (base / "d" / "my.jar")
    customJars.classpath
}
```

See [Paths][Paths] for more information on building up paths.

### Automatic Dependency Management

This method of dependency management involves specifying the direct
dependencies of your project and letting sbt handle retrieving and
updating your dependencies. sbt supports three ways of specifying these
dependencies:

-   Declarations in your project definition
-   Maven POM files (dependency definitions only: no repositories)
-   Ivy configuration and settings files

sbt uses [Apache Ivy](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/) to implement
dependency management in all three cases. The default is to use inline
declarations, but external configuration can be explicitly selected. The
following sections describe how to use each method of automatic
dependency management.

#### Inline Declarations

Inline declarations are a basic way of specifying the dependencies to be
automatically retrieved. They are intended as a lightweight alternative
to a full configuration using Ivy.

##### Dependencies

Declaring a dependency looks like:

```scala
libraryDependencies += groupID % artifactID % revision
```

or

```scala
libraryDependencies += groupID % artifactID % revision % configuration
```

See [configurations](#ivy-configurations) for details on configuration
mappings. Also, several dependencies can be declared together:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  groupID %% artifactID % revision,
  groupID %% otherID % otherRevision
)
```

If you are using a dependency that was built with sbt, double the first
`%` to be `%%`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += groupID %% artifactID % revision
```

This will use the right jar for the dependency built with the version of
Scala that you are currently using. If you get an error while resolving
this kind of dependency, that dependency probably wasn't published for
the version of Scala you are using. See [Cross Build][Cross-Build] for details.

Ivy can select the latest revision of a module according to constraints
you specify. Instead of a fixed revision like `"1.6.1"`, you specify
`"latest.integration"`, `"2.9.+"`, or `"[1.0,)"`. See the
[Ivy revisions](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.3.0/ivyfile/dependency.html#revision)
documentation for details.

##### Resolvers

sbt uses the standard Maven2 repository by default.

Declare additional repositories with the form:

```scala
resolvers += name at location
```

For example:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "org.apache.derby" % "derby" % "10.4.1.3",
    "org.specs" % "specs" % "1.6.1"
)

resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
```

sbt can search your local Maven repository if you add it as a
repository:

```scala
resolvers += "Local Maven Repository" at "file://"+Path.userHome.absolutePath+"/.m2/repository"
```

See [Resolvers][Resolvers] for details on defining other types of repositories.

##### Override default resolvers

`resolvers` configures additional, inline user resolvers. By default,
`sbt` combines these resolvers with default repositories (Maven Central
and the local Ivy repository) to form `externalResolvers`. To have more
control over repositories, set `externalResolvers` directly. To only
specify repositories in addition to the usual defaults, configure
`resolvers`.

For example, to use the Sonatype OSS Snapshots repository in addition to
the default repositories,

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
```

To use the local repository, but not the Maven Central repository:

```scala
externalResolvers := Resolver.withDefaultResolvers(resolvers.value, mavenCentral = false)
```

##### Override all resolvers for all builds

The repositories used to retrieve sbt, Scala, plugins, and application
dependencies can be configured globally and declared to override the
resolvers configured in a build or plugin definition. There are two
parts:

1.  Define the repositories used by the launcher.
2.  Specify that these repositories should override those in build
    definitions.

The repositories used by the launcher can be overridden by defining
`~/.sbt/repositories`, which must contain a `[repositories]` section
with the same format as the `Launcher` configuration file. For example:

```
[repositories]
local
my-maven-repo: https://example.org/repo
my-ivy-repo: https://example.org/ivy-repo/, [organization]/[module]/[revision]/[type]s/[artifact](-[classifier]).[ext]
```

A different location for the repositories file may be specified by the
`sbt.repository.config` system property in the sbt startup script. The
final step is to set `sbt.override.build.repos` to true to use these
repositories for dependency resolution and retrieval.

##### Explicit URL

If your project requires a dependency that is not present in a
repository, a direct URL to its jar can be specified as follows:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "slinky" % "slinky" % "2.1" from "https://slinky2.googlecode.com/svn/artifacts/2.1/slinky.jar"
```

The URL is only used as a fallback if the dependency cannot be found
through the configured repositories. Also, the explicit URL is not
included in published metadata (that is, the pom or ivy.xml).

##### Disable Transitivity

By default, these declarations fetch all project dependencies,
transitively. In some instances, you may find that the dependencies
listed for a project aren't necessary for it to build. Projects using
the Felix OSGI framework, for instance, only explicitly require its main
jar to compile and run. Avoid fetching artifact dependencies with either
`intransitive()` or `notTransitive()`, as in this example:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.felix" % "org.apache.felix.framework" % "1.8.0" intransitive()
```

##### Classifiers

You can specify the classifier for a dependency using the `classifier`
method. For example, to get the jdk15 version of TestNG:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.testng" % "testng" % "5.7" classifier "jdk15"
```

For multiple classifiers, use multiple `classifier` calls:

```scala
libraryDependencies += 
  "org.lwjgl.lwjgl" % "lwjgl-platform" % lwjglVersion classifier "natives-windows" classifier "natives-linux" classifier "natives-osx"
```

To obtain particular classifiers for all dependencies transitively, run
the `updateClassifiers` task. By default, this resolves all artifacts
with the `sources` or `javadoc` classifier. Select the classifiers to
obtain by configuring the `transitiveClassifiers` setting. For example,
to only retrieve sources:

```scala
transitiveClassifiers := Seq("sources")
```

##### Exclude Transitive Dependencies

To exclude certain transitive dependencies of a dependency, use the
`excludeAll` or `exclude` methods. The `exclude` method should be used
when a pom will be published for the project. It requires the
organization and module name to exclude. For example,

```scala
libraryDependencies += 
  "log4j" % "log4j" % "1.2.15" exclude("javax.jms", "jms")
```

The `excludeAll` method is more flexible, but because it cannot be
represented in a pom.xml, it should only be used when a pom doesn't need
to be generated. For example,

```scala
libraryDependencies +=
  "log4j" % "log4j" % "1.2.15" excludeAll(
    ExclusionRule(organization = "com.sun.jdmk"),
    ExclusionRule(organization = "com.sun.jmx"),
    ExclusionRule(organization = "javax.jms")
  )
```

See [ModuleID](../api/sbt/ModuleID.html) for API details.

To exclude a transitive dependency from all dependencies in a sequence
you can use a `map` call like this:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "log4j" % "log4j" % "1.2.15",
  "more" % "libs" % "1.0"
).map(_.exclude("commons-logging", "commons-logging"))
```

##### Download Sources

Downloading source and API documentation jars is usually handled by an
IDE plugin. These plugins use the `updateClassifiers` and
`updateSbtClassifiers` tasks, which produce an `Update-Report`
referencing these jars.

To have sbt download the dependency's sources without using an IDE
plugin, add `withSources()` to the dependency definition. For API jars,
add `withJavadoc()`. For example:

```scala
libraryDependencies += 
  "org.apache.felix" % "org.apache.felix.framework" % "1.8.0" withSources() withJavadoc()
```

Note that this is not transitive. Use the `update-*classifiers` tasks
for that.

##### Extra Attributes

[Extra attributes](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.3.0/concept.html#extra)
can be specified by passing key/value pairs to the `extra` method.

To select dependencies by extra attributes:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org" % "name" % "rev" extra("color" -> "blue")
```

To define extra attributes on the current project:

```scala
projectID := {
    val previous = projectID.value
    previous.extra("color" -> "blue", "component" -> "compiler-interface")
}
```

##### Inline Ivy XML

sbt additionally supports directly specifying the configurations or
dependencies sections of an Ivy configuration file inline. You can mix
this with inline Scala dependency and repository declarations.

For example:

```scala
ivyXML :=
  <dependencies>
    <dependency org="javax.mail" name="mail" rev="1.4.2">
      <exclude module="activation"/>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```

##### Ivy Home Directory

By default, sbt uses the standard Ivy home directory location
`\${user.home}/.ivy2/`. This can be configured machine-wide, for use by
both the sbt launcher and by projects, by setting the system property
`sbt.ivy.home` in the sbt startup script (described in
[Setup][Setup]).

For example:

```
java -Dsbt.ivy.home=/tmp/.ivy2/ ...
```

##### Checksums

sbt
([through Ivy](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/concept.html#checksum))
verifies the checksums of downloaded files by default. It also publishes
checksums of artifacts by default. The checksums to use are specified by
the *checksums* setting.

To disable checksum checking during update:

```scala
checksums in update := Nil
```

To disable checksum creation during artifact publishing:

```scala
checksums in publishLocal := Nil

checksums in publish := Nil
```

The default value is:

```scala
checksums := Seq("sha1", "md5")
```

<a name="conflict-management"></a>

##### Conflict Management

The conflict manager decides what to do when dependency resolution
brings in different versions of the same library. By default, the latest
revision is selected. This can be changed by setting `conflictManager`,
which has type [ConflictManager](../api/sbt/ConflictManager.html).
See the
[Ivy documentation](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/settings/conflict-managers.html)
for details on the different conflict managers. For example, to specify
that no conflicts are allowed,

```scala
conflictManager := ConflictManager.strict
```

With this set, any conflicts will generate an error. To resolve a
conflict, you must configure a dependency override, which is explained in a later section.

<a name="eviction-warning"></a>

##### Eviction warning

The following direct dependencies will introduce a conflict on the akka-actor
version because banana-rdf requires akka-actor 2.1.4.

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.w3" %% "banana-rdf" % "0.4",
  "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-actor" % "2.3.7",
)
```

The default conflict manager will select the newer version of akka-actor,
2.3.7. This can be confirmed in the output of `show update`, which
shows the newer version as being selected and the older version as evicted.

```
> show update
[info] compile:

[info]  com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.10
[info]    - 2.3.7
...
[info]    - 2.1.4
...
[info]      evicted: true
[info]      evictedReason: latest-revision
...
[info]      callers: org.w3:banana-rdf_2.10:0.4
```

Furthermore, the binary version compatibility of the akka-actor 2.1.4 and 2.3.7 are not guaranteed since the second segment has bumped up. sbt 0.13.6+ detects this automatically and prints out the following warning:

```
[warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies.
[warn] Here are some of the libraries that were evicted:
[warn]  * com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.10:2.1.4 -> 2.3.7
[warn] Run 'evicted' to see detailed eviction warnings
```

Since akka-actor 2.1.4 and 2.3.7 are not binary compatible, the only way to fix this is to downgrade your dependency to akka-actor 2.1.4, or upgrade banana-rdf to use akka-actor 2.3.

##### Overriding a version

For binary compatible conflicts, sbt provides dependency overrides.
They are configured with the
`dependencyOverrides` setting, which is a set of `ModuleIDs`. For
example, the following dependency definitions conflict because spark
uses log4j 1.2.16 and scalaxb uses log4j 1.2.17:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
   "org.spark-project" %% "spark-core" % "0.5.1",
   "org.scalaxb" %% "scalaxb" % "1.0.0"
)
```

The default conflict manager chooses the latest revision of log4j,
1.2.17:

```
> show update
[info] compile:
[info]    log4j:log4j:1.2.17: ...
...
[info]    (EVICTED) log4j:log4j:1.2.16
...
```

To change the version selected, add an override:

```scala
dependencyOverrides += "log4j" % "log4j" % "1.2.16"
```

This will not add a direct dependency on log4j, but will force the
revision to be 1.2.16. This is confirmed by the output of `show update`:

```
> show update
[info] compile:
[info]    log4j:log4j:1.2.16
...
```

> **Note:** this is an Ivy-only feature and will not be included in a
> published pom.xml.

##### Unresolved dependencies error

Adding the following dependency to your project will result to an unresolved dependencies error of vpp 2.2.1:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.cayenne.plugins" % "maven-cayenne-plugin" % "3.0.2"
```

sbt 0.13.6+ will try to reconstruct dependencies tree when it fails to resolve a managed dependency. This is an approximation, but it should help you figure out where the problematic dependency is coming from. When possible sbt will display the source position next to the modules:

```
[warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[warn]  ::          UNRESOLVED DEPENDENCIES         ::
[warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[warn]  :: foundrylogic.vpp#vpp;2.2.1: not found
[warn]  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[warn] 
[warn]  Note: Unresolved dependencies path:
[warn]      foundrylogic.vpp:vpp:2.2.1
[warn]        +- org.apache.cayenne:cayenne-tools:3.0.2
[warn]        +- org.apache.cayenne.plugins:maven-cayenne-plugin:3.0.2 (/foo/some-test/build.sbt#L28)
[warn]        +- d:d_2.10:0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

<a name="ivy-configurations"></a>

##### Configurations

Ivy configurations are a useful feature for your build when you need
custom groups of dependencies, such as for a plugin. Ivy configurations
are essentially named sets of dependencies. You can read the
[Ivy documentation](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.3.0/tutorial/conf.html)
for details.

The built-in use of configurations in sbt is similar to scopes in Maven.
sbt adds dependencies to different classpaths by the configuration that
they are defined in. See the description of
[Maven Scopes](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Scope)
for details.

You put a dependency in a configuration by selecting one or more of its
configurations to map to one or more of your project's configurations.
The most common case is to have one of your configurations `A` use a
dependency's configuration `B`. The mapping for this looks like
`"A->B"`. To apply this mapping to a dependency, add it to the end of
your dependency definition:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "2.1.3" % "test->compile"
```

This says that your project's `"test"` configuration uses `ScalaTest`'s
`"compile"` configuration. See the
[Ivy documentation](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.3.0/tutorial/conf.html)
for more advanced mappings. Most projects published to Maven
repositories will use the `"compile"` configuration.

A useful application of configurations is to group dependencies that are
not used on normal classpaths. For example, your project might use a
`"js"` configuration to automatically download jQuery and then include
it in your jar by modifying `resources`. For example:

```scala
ivyConfigurations += config("js") hide

libraryDependencies += "jquery" % "jquery" % "1.3.2" % "js->default" from "https://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/files/jquery-1.3.2.min.js"

resources ++= update.value.select(configurationFilter("js"))
```

The `config` method defines a new configuration with name `"js"` and
makes it private to the project so that it is not used for publishing.
See [Update Report][Update-Report] for more information on selecting
managed artifacts.

A configuration without a mapping (no `"->"`) is mapped to `"default"`
or `"compile"`. The `->` is only needed when mapping to a different
configuration than those. The ScalaTest dependency above can then be
shortened to:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "2.1.3" % "test"
```

#### External Maven or Ivy

For this method, create the configuration files as you would for Maven
(`pom.xml`) or Ivy (`ivy.xml` and optionally `ivysettings.xml`).
External configuration is selected by using one of the following
expressions.

##### Ivy settings (resolver configuration)

```scala
externalIvySettings()
```

or

```scala
externalIvySettings(baseDirectory.value / "custom-settings-name.xml")
```

or

```scala
externalIvySettingsURL(url("your_url_here"))
```

##### Ivy file (dependency configuration)

```scala
externalIvyFile()
```

or

```scala
externalIvyFile(Def.setting(baseDirectory.value / "custom-name.xml"))
```

Because Ivy files specify their own configurations, sbt needs to know
which configurations to use for the `compile`, `runtime`, and `test`
classpaths. For example, to specify that the `Compile` classpath should
use the 'default' configuration:

```scala
classpathConfiguration in Compile := config("default")
```

##### Maven pom (dependencies only)

```scala
externalPom()
```

or

```scala
externalPom(Def.setting(baseDirectory.value / "custom-name.xml"))
```

##### Full Ivy Example

For example, a `build.sbt` using external Ivy files might look like:

```scala
externalIvySettings()

externalIvyFile(Def.setting(baseDirectory.value / "ivyA.xml"))

classpathConfiguration in Compile := Compile

classpathConfiguration in Test := Test

classpathConfiguration in Runtime := Runtime
```

##### Forcing a revision (Not recommended)

**Note**: Forcing can create logical inconsistencies so it's no longer recommended.

To say that we prefer the version we've specified over the version from
indirect dependencies, use `force()`:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.spark-project" %% "spark-core" % "0.5.1",
  "log4j" % "log4j" % "1.2.14" force()
)
```

**Note:** this is an Ivy-only feature and cannot be included in a
published pom.xml.

##### Known limitations

Maven support is dependent on Ivy's support for Maven POMs. Known issues
with this support:

-   Specifying `relativePath` in the `parent` section of a POM will
    produce an error.
-   Ivy ignores repositories specified in the POM. A workaround is to
    specify repositories inline or in an Ivy `ivysettings.xml` file.
